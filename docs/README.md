# Client Java Docs

NOTE: See [tikv.github.io/client-java](https://tikv.github.io/client-java/) for
the rendered developer and contributor documents.

This directory contains all the source of developer and contributor
documentations in markdown format. The table of content can be found in
[./src/SUMMARY.md](./src/SUMMARY.md).

## How to contribute to the document

The rendered document is generated by `mdbook`, to get it:

```sh
cargo install mdbook
```

Build the source in your development machine:

```sh
mdbook build
```
