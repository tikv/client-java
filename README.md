## TiKV JAVA Client

A Java client for [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb)/[TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv).
It is supposed to:
+ Communicate via [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/)
+ Talk to Placement Driver searching for a region
+ Talk to TiKV for reading/writing data and the resulted data is encoded/decoded just like what we do in TiDB.
+ Talk to Coprocessor for calculation pushdown

## How to build

### Maven

The alternative way to build a usable jar for testing will be

```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

The following command can install dependencies for you.

```
mvn package
```

The jar can be found in `./target/`

## Usage

This project is designed to hook with `[pd](https://github.com/tikv/pd)` and `[tikv](https://github.com/tikv/tikv)`.

When you work with this project, you have to communicate with `pd` and `tikv`. Please run TiKV and PD in advance.

## Component: Raw Ti-Client in Java

Java Implementation of Raw TiKV-Client to support RawKVClient commands.

Demo is avaliable in [KVRawClientTest](https://github.com/birdstorm/KVRawClientTest/)

### Build
```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

### Add to dependency

#### Use jar for binary

Add your jar built with all dependencies into you project's library to use `tikv-client-java` as dependency

#### Use as maven dependency

After building, add following lines into your `pom.xml` if you are using Maven

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.tikv</groupId>
	<artifactId>tikv-client-java</artifactId>
	<version>3.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Entrance
`org.tikv.raw.RawKVClient`

### Create a RawKVClient

```java
import org.tikv.common.TiConfiguration;
import org.tikv.common.TiSession;
import org.tikv.raw.RawKVClient;

public class Main {
	public static void main() {
		// You MUST create a raw configuration if you are using RawKVClient.
		TiConfiguration conf = TiConfiguration.createRawDefault(YOUR_PD_ADDRESSES);
		TiSession session = TiSession.create(conf);
		RawKVClient client = session.createRawClient();
	}
}
```
